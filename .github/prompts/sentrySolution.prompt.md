Below is a step-by-step guide (with updated code examples) to fix the Sentry-related errors in your backend and align with the current Sentry documentation. The main issues you ran into stem from deprecated or renamed integrations in "@sentry/node" and confusion around custom “beforeSendTransaction” hooks. In modern Sentry versions:

• The “Handlers” and “Integrations” objects have been reorganized.
• Express integration for performance is typically imported from "@sentry/tracing".
• Custom transaction processing is done via either beforeSendTransaction (in the init config) or by writing a custom Integration.

Below are concrete fixes to each affected file. Pay close attention to the import paths, as they have changed in recent Sentry releases.

instrument.ts
Problem(s) you saw: • error TS2339: Property 'Express' does not exist on type 'typeof import("@sentry/integrations")'.
• You were importing from "@sentry/integrations" for Express integration, but modern Sentry places the Express tracing integration in "@sentry/tracing".

Recommended Fix: • Use either:

Sentry.Integrations.Http from "@sentry/node" for automatically instrumenting HTTP calls, plus
Tracing.Integrations.Express from "@sentry/tracing" for Express performance instrumentation,
nodeProfilingIntegration from "@sentry/profiling-node" for profiling support.
Below is an updated instrument.ts that uses the recommended imports:

FILE: instrument.ts
import _ as Sentry from "@sentry/node"; import _ as Tracing from "@sentry/tracing"; import { nodeProfilingIntegration } from "@sentry/profiling-node";

/\*\*

This file initializes Sentry and should be imported before other modules! / Sentry.init({ dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN, environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || "development", integrations: [ // Capture HTTP calls for performance data: new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }), // Add Express integration for performance tracing: new Tracing.Integrations.Express({ app: undefined / or your Express app if you have it here */ }), // Add Node.js profiling: nodeProfilingIntegration(), ], // Example rates: set these to something smaller in production if needed tracesSampleRate: 1.0, profilesSampleRate: 1.0, });
export default Sentry;
Notes: • If you need the “Express” integration to actually instrument routes, pass your real Express “app” reference to new Tracing.Integrations.Express({ app }). Usually, you’d do that in your main server file once the app is created.
• If you only want the Sentry error reporting (no performance), you can remove the Tracing integrations. In that case, the older style "requestHandler" or "errorHandler" may still be used.

sentry.ts
Problem(s) you saw: • error TS2769: No overload matches this call (Argument of type '"beforeSendTransaction"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"close"').
• error TS7006: Parameter 'event' implicitly has an 'any' type.
• A custom “client.on('beforeSendTransaction', ...)” is no longer recognized.
• "app" was declared but never used.

Reasons: • The “client.on('beforeSendTransaction')” callback does not exist in modern Sentry.
• For advanced transaction interception, you typically either set “beforeSendTransaction” directly in Sentry.init(...) or write a custom Integration that uses “addGlobalEventProcessor”.

How to Fix: • Remove the direct client.on("beforeSendTransaction", ...) code.
• If you just want a custom step to manipulate transaction events, do it either via beforeSendTransaction in the init config, or write a short custom integration with addGlobalEventProcessor.
• If you only want to add the Express request handler and error handler, you can do that in your main server file with Sentry.Handlers.

Below is a minimal example that logs a console statement whenever a transaction is processed, using a custom integration. We also remove the unused “app” parameter if we truly don’t use it.

FILE: sentry.ts
import \* as Sentry from "@sentry/node"; // Use this only if you have an actual Express app to reference // import { Application } from "express";

export function initSentry() { if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && process.env.SENTRY_DSN) { // Example: A custom integration for logging transaction events const TransactionLoggerIntegration: Sentry.Integration = { name: "TransactionLogger", setupOnce(addGlobalEventProcessor, getCurrentHub) { console.log("TransactionLogger integration set up"); addGlobalEventProcessor((event, hint) => { if (event.type === "transaction") { console.log("Processing a transaction event:", event.transaction); // Modify event data if needed } return event; }); }, };

} else { console.log("⚠️ Sentry not initialized (development mode or missing DSN)"); }

return Sentry; }
Notes: • If you want to define a “beforeSendTransaction” callback directly (instead of writing a custom integration), you can do so in your Sentry.init call in instrument.ts. For instance:

Sentry.init({ dsn: ..., beforeSendTransaction: (event, hint) => { // rename its name, drop certain transactions, etc. return event; } });

• The custom integration approach above is helpful if you want all transaction changes in one place, plus it’s more flexible.

Using Sentry’s Express "Handlers" in the main server file
If you want the standard request/transaction/error handlers in your main server file (for example c:\Users\lauri\tarot\backend\index.ts), do something like:

FILE: index.ts
import express from "express"; import _ as Sentry from "@sentry/node"; import _ as Tracing from "@sentry/tracing";

const app = express();

// 1. Initialize Sentry Sentry.init({ dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN, integrations: [ new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }), new Tracing.Integrations.Express({ app }), ], tracesSampleRate: 1.0, environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || "development", });

// 2. Request Handler creates a trace for every incoming request app.use(Sentry.Handlers.requestHandler()); app.use(Sentry.Handlers.tracingHandler());

// ... All your routes go here ... app.get("/", (req, res) => { res.send("Hello Sentry!"); });

// 3. Error handler must be before any other error middleware app.use(Sentry.Handlers.errorHandler());

// Start server const port = process.env.PORT ?? 3000; app.listen(port, () => { console.log(Server listening on port ${port}); });
Notes: • If you do the above, you don’t need to pass the “Express” integration in your “instrument.ts” file again.
• This is typically the recommended approach for hooking Sentry into your Express routes.
• Make sure you’re on a newer version of @sentry/node (>=7.x) and @sentry/tracing if you want the tracingHandler to work properly.

Summary of Key Changes
Remove references to “Handlers” or “Integrations” from older Sentry code that lives in "@sentry/node" or "@sentry/integrations" (older, out-of-date usage).
For end-to-end request + performance monitoring in Express, import from "@sentry/node" and "@sentry/tracing", then do Sentry.Handlers.requestHandler() and Sentry.Handlers.errorHandler() in your main server file.
If you want custom transaction modification, either use “beforeSendTransaction” in Sentry.init() or define a custom integration with addGlobalEventProcessor.
Fix TypeScript’s implicit “any” by annotating your event callbacks with Sentry.Event or using a typed signature if you’re writing a custom integration.
With these fixes in place, the compile-time errors about missing “Integrations.Express” or “Handlers” should disappear, and you’ll be aligned with modern Sentry best practices for Node + Express.
